"""Import a routed GDS into a Virtuoso library via Cadence ``strmin``.

The standalone ``strmin`` tool is invoked through SKILL ``system()`` —
strmin inherits the running Virtuoso's PATH, licence env, and working
directory, so no SSH or local-shell setup is needed.

Prerequisites
-------------
* ``virtuoso-bridge start`` is running, daemon loaded in CIW.
* The target library is already DEFINEd in the Virtuoso work dir's
  ``cds.lib``.  ``strmin`` creates the cellview directories but does
  not amend ``cds.lib``.

Reference libraries
-------------------
* ``--ref-libs <file>`` (recommended) — plain text file listing the
  referenced lib names, one per line.  Lab convention is
  ``<workdir>/ref``.  Keeps import scope explicit and auditable.
* ``--use-cds-lib`` — shortcut for strmin's magic ``-refLibList
  XST_CDS_LIB``: refs **every** lib in the work dir's cds.lib
  (including ``INCLUDE`` chains).  Unsafe unless the cds.lib is
  strictly curated — same-name cells across PDK / IP / historical
  libs will silently bind to the wrong one.

The script prints instance/shape counts of the new layout cellview as a
sanity check after import.
